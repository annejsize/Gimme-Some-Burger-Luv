# Gimme Some Burger Luv!
A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that allows user to select a burger and then 'devour' it. Hungry yet?

### Overview
Craving a burger? Then check out this app where you can enter the name of the burger you'd like to order. It then pops up on the left-side panel, waiting to be devoured. Click on the 'DEVOUR ME!' button and then the burger entry switches over to the right side of the screen.

This app is one of my first attempts at creating a full stack app using Handlebars, Sequelize, Node, and various NPM packages to make this app possible.

### Tools Used
